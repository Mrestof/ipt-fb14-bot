## TODO

### global:
- [ ] find a more suitable project hierarchy
- [ ] discuss the usefulness of "general refactor" todo's and notes
- [ ] requirements.txt: `ptb` and `ptb[job-queue]` are probably duplicates;
    check and fix if possible
- [ ] refactor
  - [ ] change variable names to make more sense
  - [ ] expand unreadable oneliners
  - [ ] replace OS calls with python alternatives
  - [ ] save temp files in temp directories, not inside the bot module hierarchy
    (don't hardcode tmp dir paths, use `tempfile` module)
- [ ] improvement
  - [ ] add function descriptions for those which lack it
  - [ ] add type annotation to all places in code
  - [ ] add decorator (or other mechanism) to log function start

### handlers:
- [ ] refactor
  - [ ] update type of the `context` argument to the new one
    (`telegram.ext.CallbackContext` -> `telegram.ext.ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE`)
  - [ ] move check for edited messages to a decorator
- [ ] improvement
  - [ ] add decorator to check for command execution rights
  - [ ] guard anything coming from `Update` to ensure it is not None
#### command:
- [ ] refactor
  - [ ] join markov functions to be more compact
- [ ] improvement
    - [ ] check if file descriptors are closed correctly
#### text:
- [ ] refactor
  - [ ] split the big handler into smaller pieces
  - [ ] merge some conditions into more compact blocks of code
  - [ ] minor stuff

### utils:
#### log:
- [ ] review the file
#### schedule:
- [ ] refactor
  - [ ] general (explain?)
  - [ ] rewrite `_output_day`
#### markov:
- [ ] review the file
- [ ] refactor:
  - [ ] get rid of dicts, maybe make it into class
    (reasoning: access by strings is too much error-prone)
  - [ ] fix all incorrect try except blocks
  - [x] unify for auf and others
#### init:
- [ ] refactor:
  - [ ] merge some methods into one class
      (old note, review the file to confirm its relevance)
  - [ ] rewrite `_get_command_attrs` to be less error-prone
      (maybe with usage of configs)
  - [ ] move command extraction from `set_commands` to separate function
#### voice:
- [ ] review the file
#### diary:
- [ ] refactor: use `defaultdict` where applicable (ex: in `diary_write_one`)
- [ ] move argument validation to decorator
- [ ] refactor _check_date return
- [ ] turn if/else block into try/except where possible
#### image:
- [ ] refactor
  - [ ] rewrite `crawl` function
    - [ ] make match statement more compact
    - [ ] use wallhaven V1 API
  - [ ] redo `remove_file` using more than 1 brain cell
    (try implementing via custom `with` API with dunder methods)
  - [x] cut indents in `resize_image`
- [ ] improvement
  - [ ] explain magic numbers


## Backlog
Here will be finished todo's (maybeÂ¿)
